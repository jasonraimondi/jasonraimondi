## Hey, :wave:, I'm Jason.

I am a technologist and computer geek.

I have been developing for the web since 2007. I've worked on everything from terrible old-school procedural spaghetti :spaghetti: monsters, to MVC frameworks, to tested, domain-driven applications. Early on, I was developing traditional server-rendered PHP applications. These days, I really enjoy full stack TypeScript.
