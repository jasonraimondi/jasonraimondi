## Hey, :wave:, I'm Jason.

I am a technologist and computer geek.

I have been developing for the web since 2007. I've worked on everything from terrible old-school procedural spaghetti :spaghetti: monsters, to fully tested applications in languages including TypeScript, Ruby, PHP, and Golang. Early on, I was developing traditional server-rendered PHP applications with some jquery on top. These days, I'm working on a lot of full stack TypeScript or Ruby on Rails.
