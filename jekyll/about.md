![My Fiance and I](https://res.cloudinary.com/jmondi/image/upload/v1535413138/IMG_6696.jpg)

My name is Jason Raimondi and I am a Full Stack Software Engineer currently living in Los Angeles, CA. I am a technologist and all around computer geek.

I have a Bachelors of Fine Arts in Digital Media from the University of Florida, with my primary focus being on the web.

I have been professionally developing for the web since 2009, primarily developing sites early on in **PHP** and **JavaScript**.  Recently, my favorite stack has is a **TypeScript** stack using **Node.js** as my server side language.

I am a student of [Clean Code](https://cleancoders.com/), a [Software Crafter](https://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/).  I have a passion for writing Clean software based on SOLID design principles. I have been a student of TDD for almost two years, beginning my journey in October 2016.  Under the guidance of [Jamie Isaacs](https://www.jamieisaacs.com/), we have successfully hit our goal of 85% coverage on 200K+ LOC API codebase at Event Farm.

I manage numerous servers for client projects. I have migrated to an entire container based deploy using **Docker**. I build applications following the [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) methodology for horizontal scalability.

If Iâ€™m not learning a new framework or language, I'm looking at the cool things people build on github, playing board games with my friends or out on the trails.
