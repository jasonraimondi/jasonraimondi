![My Fiance and I](/assets/misc/me/us.png)

My name is Jason Raimondi and I am a Full Stack Software Engineer currently living in Los Angeles, CA. I am a student of [Clean Code](https://cleancoders.com/), a [Software Crafter](https://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/).

I have a Bachelors of Fine Arts in Digital Media from the University of Florida, with my primary focus being on the web. I formed Digital Canvas Design LLC in January of 2014 to help maintain my growing number of clients.

I have been professionally developing for the web since 2009, primarily developing sites early on in **PHP** and **JavaScript**. I have experience writing client libraries in **Python** and **Ruby**. Recently, my favorite stack has been **TypeScript** on **Node.js**. I manage a number of client projects on VPS' ranging from AWS, to Linode, Digital Ocean, as well as bare metal hosting at Liquid Web. I have migrated to an entire container based deploy using **Docker**. I build applications following the [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) methodology.

I have a passion for writing Clean software based on SOLID design principles. I have been a student of TDD, practicing daily since October 2016. Under the guidance of [Jamie Isaacs](https://www.jamieisaacs.com/), we have maintained our goal of 85% coverage on 200K+ LOC API codebase at Event Farm.

I am a technologist and all around computer geek. If Iâ€™m not learning a new language or design pattern, I'm looking at the cool things people build on GitHub, playing board games with my friends or out on the trails.
