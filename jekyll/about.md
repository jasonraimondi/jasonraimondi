My name is Jason Raimondi and I am a Full Stack Software Engineer currently living in Los Angeles, CA. I am a technologist and all around computer geek.

I have a Bachelors of Fine Arts in Digital Media from the University of Florida, with my primary focus being on the web.

I have been professionally developing for the web since 2009, primarily developing sites early on in *PHP* and *JavaScript*.  Recently, my favorite stack has is a *TypeScript* stack using *Node.js* as my server side language.

I am a student of Clean Code, a Software Crafter.  I have a passion for writing Clean software based on SOLID design principles. I have been a student of TDD for almost two years, beginning my journey in October 2016.  Under the guidance of [Jamie Isaacs](https://www.jamieisaacs.com/), we have successfully hit our goal of 85% coverage on 200K+ LOC API codebase at Event Farm.

I manage numerous servers for client projects. I have migrated to an entire container based deploy, following the [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) methodology for horizontal scalability.

If Iâ€™m not learning a new framework or language, I'm looking at the cool things people build on github, playing board games with my friends or out on the trails mountain biking.
