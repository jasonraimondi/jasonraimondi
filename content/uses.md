This page lists software and hardware I use on a daily basis.

#### Editor

* **[IntelliJ Suite](https://www.jetbrains.com/)** -- If I am developing code, I am probably using an IntelliJ product..
* **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** -- If I am browsing code, or looking at a set of files, I may use VSC.
* **[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)** -- A text editor for editing large text files.
* **[Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com/vim/)** -- Dark, sometimes I really like Monokai.

#### Desktop Apps

* **[Firefox](https://firefox.com)** -- [Use Alfred to switch from Google Chrome to Firefox]({{< ref "/posts/018_using-an-alfred-workflow-to-assist-in-switching-from-google-chrome-to-firefox.md" >}}).
* **[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)** -- Alfred is great, use [workflows to enhance](https://github.com/zenorocha/alfred-workflows). It also comes with a clipboard history manager and tool to store your text snippets.
* **[Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/)** -- The greatest keybinding specific alternative to better touch tool.
* **[Sequel Pro](#)** -- Historically, it was the best MySQL GUI for Mac. It is not running so well on newer versions of Mac. 
* **[Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html)** -- Little Snitch is a really nice GUI firewall for Mac. You can use it to monitor your Mac's networking, and even entirely block network access all together from running applications. 
* **[Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)** -- Nice calendar.
* **[iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)** -- I used to use Bear, and I really loved it for a long time. What made me switch to iA Writer was its ability to store your notes in the iCloud Drive filesystem. Actual markdown files that I could back up... Sold. This [markdown writing workflow](https://www.macstories.net/ios/my-markdown-writing-and-collaboration-workflow-powered-by-working-copy-3-6-icloud-drive-and-github/) is also a great perk.
* **[1Password](https://1password.com/)** -- Essential....
* **[Telegram](https://telegram.org/)** -- Secure messaging.
* **[Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash)** -- Offline software documentation.
* **[Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/)** -- Hide running status bar applications.
* **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** -- Run anything, then delete it.
