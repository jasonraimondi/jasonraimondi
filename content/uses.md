This page lists software and hardware I use on a daily basis.

#### Workstation

* **[Laptop Arm Mount](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010QZD6I6)** - Large Dell Monitor with Powered USB-C connection so it is just a single port (with the newer MacBook Pros).
* **[Dual Arm Monitor Stand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MIBN71I)** - Having both my monitor and laptop floating above my desk is the best
* **[Moonlander Mark 1 Split Ergonomic Keyboard](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/)** - Such an incredible keyboard. Has a steep learning curve, but absolutely worth it.

* **[Bose Quiet Comfort 35](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0756CYWWD)** - I just really like how they fit, they are very comfortable during long term wear.
