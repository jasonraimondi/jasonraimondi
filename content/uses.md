This page lists software and hardware I use on a daily basis.

#### Editor

* **[IntelliJ Suite](https://www.jetbrains.com/)** -- If I am developing code, I am probably using an IntelliJ product..
* **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** -- If I am browsing code, or looking at a set of files, I may use VSC.
* **[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)** -- A text editor for opening single text files.
* **[One Dark Theme](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11938-one-dark-theme/)** -- Dark theme for the editor

#### Wares

* **[Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)** -- [Use Alfred to switch from Google Chrome to Firefox]({{< ref "/posts/018_using-an-alfred-workflow-to-assist-in-switching-from-google-chrome-to-firefox.md" >}}).
* **[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)** -- Alfred is great, use [workflows to enhance](https://github.com/zenorocha/alfred-workflows). It also comes with a clipboard history manager and tool to store your text snippets.
* **[Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/)** -- The greatest keybinding specific alternative to better touch tool, although I saw this recently is abandoned too... So if anyone knows any alternatives, DM me.
* **[TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/)** -- The not-so-free successor to Sequel Pro. Well, technically it is not a successor, but Sequel Pro as far as I am aware is abandon-ware that has lackluster support on current OS X Versions. 
* **[Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html)** -- Little Snitch is a really nice GUI firewall for Mac. You can use it to monitor your Mac's networking, and even entirely block network access all together from running applications. 
* **[Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)** -- Nice calendar, although the version 3 upgrade introduced subscription pricing
* **[iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)** -- I used to use Bear, and I really loved it for a long time. What made me switch to iA Writer was its ability to store your notes in the iCloud Drive filesystem. Actual markdown files that I could back up... Sold. This [markdown writing workflow](https://www.macstories.net/ios/my-markdown-writing-and-collaboration-workflow-powered-by-working-copy-3-6-icloud-drive-and-github/) is also a great perk.
* **[1Password](https://1password.com/)** -- Essential....
* **[Telegram](https://telegram.org/)** -- Secure messaging.
* **[Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash)** -- Offline software documentation.
* **[Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/)** -- Hide running status bar applications.
* **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** -- Run anything, then delete it.
* **[Keeping You Awake](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake)** -- Lighter, open-source Caffeine alternative.

#### Self Hosted

* **[Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/)** -- Selfhosted git web ui.
* **[Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/)** -- Lightweight analytics.
* **[Invoice Ninja](https://www.invoiceninja.com/)** -- Full featured accounting.
* **[Kodi](https://kodi.tv/)** -- Media Client
* **[Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.media)** -- Media Server.

#### Code

* TypeScript/JS
* Golang
* Ruby
* PHP
