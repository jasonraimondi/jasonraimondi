My name is Jason Raimondi and I am a Full Stack Software Engineer from the east coast, living on the west coast. My professional focus has been in web systems; everything from designing to building and deploying server and client web applications. What I really am is a technologist and all around computer geek. Give me a computer and I will be hacking in minutes, occupied for days.

I have been professionally developing for the web since 2009. Early on I was primarily developing sites in **PHP** and **JavaScript**. Recently, my favorite stack has been **Golang** (so small) or **Node.js** (so easy) in **TypeScript** on the server, and **React** in TypeScript or just Vue.js on the client. I have experience writing modular applications and have migrated to an entire containerized based deploy using **Docker** and Docker **Swarm**. 

My passion is for writing software with a clean architecture. I have been a student of TDD, practicing daily since late 2016. I build applications following the [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) methodology.

I worked received a really fancy piece of paper in 2013 from the _University of Florida_ that reads: _Bachelors of Fine Arts_ in _Digital Media_. I formed Digital Canvas Design LLC in January of 2014 to maintain my professional work.

If I’m not learning a new language or practicing software architecture design patterns, I'm out with my amazing fiancé or watching, listening to, or reading to a good movie or book. 

Feel free to check out my [resume](./resume) or peek at some of [the books I have been reading.](https://www.goodreads.com/jasonraimondi)

Oh, hello there. 

This wasnt really meant for you, but I can see why you might think it was. One day (hopefully soon) I will update this and either add some cool stuff to the console or more information about my technical skills in the comments, this was just text that I didnt want to lose to VC and forget it existed.

This text:

The Event Farm API was rewritten using TDD practices, and has maintained an 85% coverage on a roughly 200K+ (circa spring 2018) and growing LOC Rest API written in PHP 7.1 using **Domain Driven Design** and a Command/Query JSON REST API.
