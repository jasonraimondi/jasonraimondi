My name is Jason Raimondi and I am a Full Stack Software Engineer based out of Los Angeles. My focus has been in web systems, building and deploying server and client web applications. I am a technologist and all around computer geek; give me a computer and I will be hacking in minutes, occupied for days.

I have been professionally developing for the web since 2009. Early on I was primarily developing sites in **PHP** and **JavaScript**. Recently, my favorite stack has been **Golang** (so small) or **Node.js** (so easy) in **TypeScript** on the server, and **React** in TypeScript or just Vue.js on the client. I have experience writing modular applications and have migrated to an entire containerized based deploy using **Docker** and Docker **Swarm**. 

My passion is for writing software with a clean architecture. I have been a student of TDD, practicing daily since late 2016. I build applications following the [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) methodology.

I received a really fancy piece of paper in 2013 from the _University of Florida_ that reads: _Bachelors of Fine Arts_ in _Digital Media_. I formed Digital Canvas Design LLC in January of 2014 to maintain my professional work.

If I’m not learning a new language or practicing software architecture design patterns, I'm out with my amazing fiancé or watching, listening to, or reading to a good movie or book. 

Feel free to check out my [resume](./resume) or peek at some of [the books I have been reading.](https://www.goodreads.com/jasonraimondi)

The Event Farm API was rewritten using TDD practices, and has maintained an 85% coverage on a roughly 200K+ (circa spring 2018) and growing LOC Rest API written in PHP 7.1 using **Domain Driven Design** and a Command/Query JSON REST API.
