I'm @adamwathan, a full-stack developer, entrepreneur, and Justin's worst nightmare.

I share everything I know about making awesome software through my articles, talks, screencasts, podcast, and courses.

In 2016, I released my first book and left my job to make things full-time that help other developers build better software.

Right now I'm working on Tailwind CSS, and I share updates about my progress in my work journal.

Curious about how I work? Check out my uses page for a full list of all the software, gadgets, and services I use.
