<div class="home">

<h1 class="animoji-me">Hey :wave:, I'm Jason.</h1>

## I am a <span id="adjective1">technologist</span> and <span id="adjective2">computer geek</span>.

I work at <a href="//twitter.com/hitrecord" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">@HITRECORD</a> as a Staff Software Engineer.

I have been developing for the web since 2007. I've worked on everything from terrible old-school procedural spaghetti :spaghetti: monsters, to MVC frameworks, to 100% tested domain-driven applications. Early on, I was developing traditional server-rendered PHP applications. These days, I can work on whatever you need.

I have professional experience building modular, horizontally scalable applications.

If Iâ€™m not hanging out with my amazing [wife](//kimcalderone.com) and pup, I am most likely <span id="doing1">learning a new language</span> or <span id="doing2">practicing software architecture design patterns</span>.
