## I am a technologist and computer geek.

I work at <a href="https://twitter.com/hitrecord" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">@HITRECORD</a> doing a lot of ops work. Recently, I've been focusing on containerizing our Ruby application and deploying us on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service.

I have been professionally developing for the web since 2009. Early on, I was primarily developing traditional server rendered **PHP** applications with a bit of **JavaScript**. Recently, my favorite stack has been full stack **TypeScript**.

I have experience writing modular, horizontally scalable applications.

If I’m not learning a new language or practicing software architecture design patterns, I’m out with my amazing [wife](//kimcalderone.com), or watching, listening to, or reading something good.

My passion is for writing software with a clean architecture. I have been a student of TDD, practicing daily since late 2016. I build applications following the [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) methodology.

I received a really fancy piece of paper in 2013 from the _University of Florida_ that: _Bachelors of Fine Arts_ in _Digital Media_. I formed Digital Canvas Design LLC in January of 2014 to maintain my professional work.

If I’m not learning a new language or practicing software architecture design patterns, I'm out with my amazing  or watching, listening to, or reading to a good movie or book.
