description: Uses the twitter stream api to monitor a list of users.json and run any
  users they mention in tweets through botometer.iuni.iu.edu to see make sure any
  users you're interacting with are not bots

title: Don't Feed the Bots
---

Based on a list of users, mostly myself and a few friends, we will stream tweets and run mentioned users through botometer. If a user is above the threshold set, @dontfeedthebots will reply and let the user know that the person they are interacting with is a bot.
